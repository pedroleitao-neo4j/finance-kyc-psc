    "UBO analysis is a critical component of KYC (Know Your Customer) processes, enabling organizations to identify the ultimate beneficial owners of companies. This notebook exemplifies how to perform UBO analysis using Neo4j, focusing on majority indirect control and voting rights indirect control, using Companies House data.\n",

The notebook demonstrates how to query this data, visualize the relationships, and interpret the results to identify UBOs effectively."

In such cases, we can infer indirect control by analyzing the share ownership structure and applying certain rules (e.g., if a person owns more than 50% of the shares, they have effective control). This can be visualized by adding inferred relationships to the graph, which can be done through additional queries or data processing steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "Because we have geolocation data for companies and controlling organizations and persons, we can also visualize the \"Russian Doll\" structures in a geographical context. This can help identify patterns of control across different jurisdictions, which is particularly relevant for UBO analysis in the context of offshore companies and tax havens.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Follow the Color (Red to Blue): The path begins in Red, representing the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) or the source of control. As the ownership chain passes through intermediaries, the color transitions to yellow and finally \"cools down\" to Blue, which marks the final Target Company or asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Watch the Altitude: The height of the arcs corresponds to the depth of the chain. The initial control relationships (the UBO) tower high above the map, representing overarching influence, while the final links \"land\" at the specific location of the asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spotting the Loop: A normal business structure might show a direct line (e.g., London → Manchester). A \"Russian Doll\" structure is revealed by the geographic detour: a path that starts in the UK, \"hops\" to a tax haven (like the BVI, Jersey or the Isle of Man), and then loops back to own a property just a few miles from where it started."

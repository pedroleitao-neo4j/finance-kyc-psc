    "# A KYC/AML Graph Pipeline for UK Corporate Registry Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a high-throughput ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to ingest, cleanse, and structure UK corporate registry data into a Neo4j knowledge graph. The system consumes two primary datasets from Companies House: the [\"Basic Company Data,\"](https://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html) which provides foundational entity details, and the [\"Persons with Significant Control\" (PSC) snapshot,](https://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_pscdata.html) which details the beneficial ownership structures. By leveraging [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) and the [Neo4j Spark plugin](https://neo4j.com/docs/spark/current/), the pipeline efficiently joins millions of company records with their corresponding officers and controlling entities, creating a unified view of corporate governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation logic goes beyond simple data mapping by actively enriching the source information. Key enhancements include the geocoding of registered addresses to latitude and longitude coordinates, the deterministic generation of unique identifiers for individuals and organizations to resolve entity duplication, and the parsing of unstructured \"nature of control\" text into quantitative voting and ownership percentages. The final output is a rich property graph that models Companies, Officers, Addresses, and their multi-layered relationships, including historical name changes and complex control hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why we built this pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary business driver for this pipeline is the need to transition from flat, tabular compliance data to a connected graph structure that reflects the reality of corporate networks. In the context of Know Your Business (KYB) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows, tabular data often obscures indirect relationships and complex ownership chains. By modeling these entities as a graph, organizations can instantly traverse ownership structures to identify [Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs)](https://www.swift.com/risk-and-compliance/know-your-customer-kyc/ultimate-beneficial-owner-ubo), detecting risk patterns that would require expensive recursive joins in a traditional relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enrichment features provide immediate value for risk assessment and investigative intelligence. The integration of geospatial data (converting locations to geographic points) allows analysts to identify clusters of companies registered at high-risk locations or residential addresses, a common indicator of shell company activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precise parsing of voting rights and share ownership percentages enables granular querying for control thresholds (e.g., identifying all individuals with >25% control), while the inclusion of sanctions flags and identity verification details directly supports automated compliance screening and due diligence processes."

    "## Environment Setup and Spark Session Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "We first initialize the data processing environment by loading necessary environment variables and configuring the Apache Spark session. We rely on the `python-dotenv` library to securely manage credentials such as the Neo4j URI, user, and password, ensuring that sensitive information is not hardcoded in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spark session is configured with the Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark, which allows for high-throughput data transfer between Spark DataFrames and the Neo4j Graph Database. We allocate substantial driver memory (32GB) to handle the large datasets and explicitly set the `spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy` to ensure compatibility with various date formats found in the source files.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you are planning to run this notebook, ensure you do so in an environment with sufficient resources (e.g., a cluster or a local machine with enough RAM). The Neo4j database will also require appropriate configuration to handle the incoming data volume, including setting up indexes and constraints for optimal performance. The total running time for this pipeline is likely to be in the range of **10 to 30 minutes**, depending on your environment."

We then use a window function to look ahead in the history and link each name to its successor using a `PREVIOUS_NAME_OF` relationship. This structure allows us to traverse the linear timeline of a company's identity changes directly within the graph."
